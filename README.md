# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on Google Colab

In my exploration of the Hugging Face Hub, I discovered GPT-2, a potent language model known for its text generation capabilities. However, I found it lacking in meaningful dialogue and contextual understanding. Determined to enhance its conversational abilities, I embarked on a journey of fine-tuning using Google Colab.

Using the Alpaca dataset tailored for conversational AI, I meticulously adjusted GPT-2's parameters in the Colab environment. Each iteration brought the model closer to understanding human conversation dynamics, transforming it into a more responsive agent. It was more than just programmingâ€”it was about teaching the model to listen, comprehend, and respond thoughtfully.

**Limitations**
- Limited memory prevented the import of a large model, leading to the use of GPT-2, a smaller but capable language model.
- GPU resources were constrained, with the available GPU capable of handling only up to 140 million parameters, in contrast to the rumored 170 billion parameters of GPT-4.
- GPT-2 may lack in-depth understanding or provide superficial explanations due to constraints in the training data, which might have been truncated to fit within the available resources.
- Humor generated by GPT-2 finetuned is very bad, even more than me.
- GPT-2 can not translate languages.
But being a very small model with 140 millions paramerters it did good, though we cannot compare it with LLMs which are in Billions of parameters( comparing cycle with spacship ).

**Final Note** 
This project was a thrilling and educational journey. Despite the constraints and challenges, I learned an immense amount about fine-tuning models and working within the limitations of available resources. The process tested my technical skills and fostered a spirit of innovation and perseverance. Iâ€™m proud of the progress made and the valuable insights gained along the way. Feel free to critique and share your thoughtsâ€”Iâ€™m eager to hear feedback and continue growing in this fascinating field of AI.
