# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on Google Colab

In my exploration of the Hugging Face Hub, I discovered GPT-2, a potent language model known for its text generation capabilities. However, I found it lacking in meaningful dialogue and contextual understanding. Determined to enhance its conversational abilities, I embarked on a journey of fine-tuning using Google Colab.

Using the Alpaca dataset tailored for conversational AI, I meticulously adjusted GPT-2's parameters in the Colab environment. Each iteration brought the model closer to understanding human conversation dynamics, transforming it into a more responsive agent. It was more than just programming—it was about teaching the model to listen, comprehend, and respond thoughtfully.

**Limitations**
- Limited memory prevented the import of a large model, leading to the use of GPT-2, a smaller but capable language model.
- GPU resources were constrained, with the available GPU capable of handling only up to 140 million parameters, in contrast to the rumored 170 billion parameters of GPT-4.
- GPT-2 may lack in-depth understanding or provide superficial explanations due to constraints in the training data, which might have been truncated to fit within the available resources.
- Humor generated by GPT-2 finetuned is very bad, even more than me.
- GPT-2 can not translate languages.
But being a very small model with 140 millions paramerters it did good, though we cannot compare it with LLMs which are in Billions of parameters( comparing cycle with spacship ).

**Final Note** 
This project was a thrilling and educational journey. Despite the constraints and challenges, I learned an immense amount about fine-tuning models and working within the limitations of available resources. The process tested my technical skills and fostered a spirit of innovation and perseverance. I’m proud of the progress made and the valuable insights gained along the way. Feel free to critique and share your thoughts—I’m eager to hear feedback and continue growing in this fascinating field of AI.
